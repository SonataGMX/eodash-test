## Tree cover loss

Tree cover loss estimates, derived from Sentinel-1 polarimetry
SAR data pre-processed with SAGRIS production system
(http://www.sagris.eu), cover all scenarios of natural and man-made 
causes of the loss of trees, including natural tree fall due to aging,
severe storms, forestry maintenance activities, as well as legal or
illegal timber production. This service has high sensitivity (minimum
mapping unit - 100 sq.m) and assessment of the whole winter season 2024/25 (October-April) in Baltic states (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia).
